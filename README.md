# gen-REACT-PORTFOLIO

## User Story

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Description

My aim is to create a high value portfolio displaying my projects, experience and information in general about me.
